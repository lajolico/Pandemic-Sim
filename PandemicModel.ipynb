    "In this notebook, we'll develop a model of a pandemic as it directly spreads in a susceptible population, and explore the effectiveness of interventions such as vaccination and quarantining . Epidemiologic modeling is important for understanding disease spread and developing plans to control the spread. In Section II, we establish a strong foundation by building the simpliest SI model to discover the underlying ordinary differential equations that dictate the rules for the system and an inuitive sense for how to extend the model to capture more nuances which correspond to a more realistic model.\n",

    "According to 2022 census records, the city of Banner Elk in North Carolina has a population of approximately 1,000 people. Banner Elk will be the center of our attention as we simulate the spread of an infection in the city. To simplify our study we assume the town will have a fixed population, i.e., no vital processes. We introduce well-known models of infectious disease, the SI model, the SIR (Kermack-McKendrick) model, SIS model, SIRS model, SIRV model and use them to explain the progression of the disease over the course of 2,000 days.\n",

For example, a $I(t)$ node has a choice on whether to \"go out\" or quarantine. If they decide to go out, then they risk infecting on of their friends and family. Further, each node, when infected has a $infection.prob$, if the $infection.prob$ is greater than a random generated number, they will infect that node. It is important to note that on average, each node has one to five connections. This can increase dramatically, if a node decides to go to a party or a big event, with other nodes. To model this, we implemented an increase of connections between nodes, based on friends/families in the community.\n",

    "## SI Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we consider a model with no recovery rate, a person is considered to be either susceptible or infected. A real life example of a SI disease is the herpesvirus family of viruses which characteristically establishes latent infection within specific tissues [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8157/). The interaction between the two classes of population results in a flow from susceptible to infected over time. We can write this as the following rates of change for S and I respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{dS}{dt} = -rSI$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{dI}{dt} = rSI$\n",
    "\n",
    "This nonlinear system of differential equation can be solved assuming the population remains constant by adding the two equations. We arrive at $\\frac{dS}{dt} + \\frac{dI}{dt} = 0$ which can be integrated giving us $S(t) + I(t) = S(0) + I(0)$. The initial population is $N$ so we write $S(t) + I(t) = N$ to allow us to replace $S$ in the rates above with $N - I$. Our new equation is as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{dI}{dt} = r(N-I)I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $I(0) > 0$, then the equilibrium $N$ will be approached as $t$ approaches infinity. Simply put the SI model predicts that everyone will become infected as long as there is an initial infected population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we choose to investigate the value $R_0$ which is defined as the total number of new infected caused by each infected individual, on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "$R_0 = 0.0015$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a population of 1000 we expect an infected person to cause 15 new infections on average.\n",

    "As you can tell above. We have a significant increase of people that acquired the infection, than those that didn't. With a mask stopping 83% of an infection actually occuring for S(t) people, we had a significant decrease. Based on our evidence, masks do something and not anything at all. However, different types of masks and their grade is not included into these scenarios, so do keep that in mind."

It is important to note that these models do not take into account all variables that can occur during a pandemic, because humans and viruses can be unpredictable sometimes. Which leaves much to understand. "
